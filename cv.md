## Dossier: Amirreza Vishteh

Amirreza Vishteh is a new-generation AI researcher shaped by Iran’s elite engineering pipeline. He ranked **#475** in the national Mathematics Concours (top **0.3%** of ~150,000 applicants), earned his **BSc in Computer Engineering at IUST (2020–2024)**, and is now an **MSc student in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology** (Data Science & Machine Learning group). His trajectory spans full-stack engineering—from VHDL and algorithms to transformer architectures—and now centers on AI safety, trustworthy NLP, and affective computing.

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Research focus:** Defending Large Language Models against backdoor attacks and advancing Persian NLP with affective computing applications.
- **Academic identity:** A synthesis of **Trustworthy AI** (The Sentinel’s Dilemma, backdoor defense, NAS robustness) and **Computational Linguistics & Mental Health** (DadmaTools v2, sentiment analysis, psychological health chatbots).
- **Current role:** Member of Sharif University’s Data Science & ML group; **Teaching Assistant for Stochastic Processes (Fall 2025)**—reflecting strong command of probability and generative-model foundations.

## 2. Research Identity
1. **Trustworthy AI & Safety** — Investigates vulnerabilities in LLMs, benchmarks backdoor attacks (BackdoorBench), and studies Neural Architecture Search (FTT-NAS) to harden model design.
2. **Computational Linguistics & Affective Computing** — Builds infrastructure for low-resource Persian NLP (DadmaTools v2) and designs multimodal sentiment systems to connect linguistic cues with psychological insight.

## 3. Academic Context
- **Sharif University of Technology (2024–Present):** MSc in Computer Engineering; TA for Stochastic Processes; positioned within Iran’s most selective engineering program.
- **Iran University of Science and Technology (2020–2024):** BSc in Computer Engineering; curriculum progression from foundational math/physics to AI, CV, and NLP; developed hardware-software fluency essential for secure neural architectures.
- **Salam Schools → Mathematics Concours (2020):** Early acceleration through Olympiad-style training; three-digit rank enabling admission to Iran’s top-tier public universities.

## 4. Portfolio Highlights
- **DadmaTools v2 (Persian NLP):** Contributed token-classification models (Trankit on Bijankhan) to improve normalization, POS tagging, and dependency parsing for low-resource Persian text.
- **Psychological Health Chatbot (2025):** Transformer-based conversational agent combining DadmaTools parsing with emotion recognition to support mental-health triage; co-authored with collaborators from Microsoft Research and University of Ghent.
- **Affective Computing Projects:**
  - **Wav2Vec2 Sentiment Analysis (Shemo):** Fine-tuned speech emotion model achieving ~94% accuracy by leveraging audio tone and transcripts.
  - **Multimodal Sentiment (Persian-3classes):** Fuses VGG-16 image features with BiLSTM text embeddings to capture sarcasm and context beyond unimodal signals.
- **The Sentinel’s Dilemma (AI Safety):** Survey and experimental work on backdoor attacks in LLMs, exploring detection and defense strategies for hidden triggers.

## 5. Pedagogy, Philosophy, and Aspirations
- **Teaching while learning:** Embraces dual roles as student and instructor; TA in probability-heavy coursework mirrors his focus on stochastic foundations of generative AI.
- **Future-proofing skills:** Prioritizes algorithms, mathematical rigor, and reproducible research over transient tech trends.
- **Global outlook:** Active collaborations with Sharif, IUST, Microsoft Research, and University of Ghent; aspires to doctoral studies in leading international programs (e.g., Oxford) to advance the AI safety community.
