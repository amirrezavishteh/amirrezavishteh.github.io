### 🎯 Career Focus Areas

**My research identity** is anchored in two complementary domains: 

1. **AI Safety and Trustworthy AI** — Focusing on defending Large Language Models against backdoor attacks and securing neural architectures through comprehensive benchmarking (BackdoorBench, FTT-NAS)

2. **Natural Language Processing for Low-Resource Languages** — Emphasis on Persian NLP infrastructure development (DadmaTools v2) and affective computing applications

I am driven by a commitment to build AI systems that are not only technically robust but also socially beneficial—addressing real-world challenges in mental health support, linguistic diversity, and AI safety. My trajectory from IUST to Sharif reflects an intentional progression toward independent research leadership and international collaboration in advancing the frontiers of trustworthy AI.
