## 🎓 Courses & Learning Path Summary

**From foundational CS to AI Safety and NLP** — A deliberate progression through mathematics, hardware design, algorithms, and machine learning, reflecting commitment to understanding AI systems from logic gates to transformer architectures.

---

## Academic Development

Builds on IUST and Sharif coursework spanning core CS, hardware, probability, and NLP so I can contribute to AI safety, Persian NLP, and neural architecture work.

### 💡 Learning Philosophy

Learning happens in tandem with teaching: every course, TA experience, or certification cements a conceptual foundation that fuels ongoing research. I balance formal seminars (e.g., HBC2024) and Coursera tracks with self-directed projects to keep both theory and practice fresh.
