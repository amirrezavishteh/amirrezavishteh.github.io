## 📸 My Photo Gallery

As an AI researcher immersed in the theoretical and technical dimensions of model safety and computational linguistics, I believe in the importance of capturing and preserving the human moments that complement rigorous academic work. This gallery showcases the personal side of my journey—the experiences, relationships, and memories that ground my research in real-world impact and meaning.

### Gallery Overview

These photographs document formative chapters of my life—from childhood in Iran, through my years at IUST (Iran University of Science and Technology) and Sharif University, to the present. While my professional focus centers on **Trustworthy AI and Security**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Affective Computing**, these images remind me of the human-centric purpose behind the work: building AI systems that are not only technically sound but also socially beneficial and ethically grounded.

  <h3>Beyond the Research</h3>
  <p>My career trajectory—from a national university entrance rank of #475 to my current role as a Master's student at Sharif University—is fundamentally shaped by the relationships, mentors, and personal experiences documented in these images. I subscribe to a philosophy of simultaneous teaching and learning, rigorous algorithmic thinking, and competence-driven achievement. Yet behind every publication on backdoor attacks, Persian NLP pipelines, and psychological health chatbots is a human who values connection, growth, and the preservation of meaningful moments.</p>
