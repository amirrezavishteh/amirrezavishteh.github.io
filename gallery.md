  <h3>Beyond the Research</h3>
  <p>My career trajectory—from a national university entrance rank of #475 to my current role as a Master's student at Sharif University—is fundamentally shaped by the relationships, mentors, and personal experiences documented in these images. I subscribe to a philosophy of simultaneous teaching and learning, rigorous algorithmic thinking, and competence-driven achievement. Yet behind every publication on backdoor attacks, Persian NLP pipelines, and psychological health chatbots is a human who values connection, growth, and the preservation of meaningful moments.</p>
  <p><strong>Research Themes:</strong> AI Safety & Backdoor Attacks • Trustworthy Large Language Models • Persian Natural Language Processing (DadmaTools) • Multimodal Sentiment Analysis • Psychological Health Chatbots</p>
